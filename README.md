# Mod1_Movie_Project

In this project I set out to see what factors correlate to and perhaps cause movies to be successful. <br/>

The questions I posed were as follows:<br/>
What genre and MPAA rating combinations produce the most highly rated films?<br/>
Which genres produce the most profitable films?<br/>
Which director produces the highest (IMDb) rated films?<br/>
Which director produces the highest grossing films in the box office?<br/>
I also took a brief look at how IMDb and Metacritic ratings compare to one another. <br/>

I used Beautiful Soup, requests, json, numpy, locale, and pandas, to scrape, clean, and manipulate my data. <br/>
Then used matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate my results. <br/>

My data used is a blend of the supplied CSV & TSV documents, a dataset of the 1000 top movies that I scraped from IMDb, and extensive use of the OMDB API. <br/>
My cleaning of the supplied data is found in DataCleaningProvidedCSVs.ipynb and the remainder of my code is found in ScrapingCLeaningModeling.ipynb.<br/>
