# Mod1_Movie_Project

In this project I set out to see what factors correlate to and perhaps cause movies to be successful. 

The questions I posed were as follows:
What genre and MPAA rating combinations produce the most highly rated films?
Which genres produce the most profitable films?
Which director produces the highest (IMDb) rated films?
Which director produces the highest grossing films in the box office?
I also took a brief look at how IMDb and Metacritic ratings compare to one another. 

I used Beautiful Soup, requests, json, numpy, locale, and pandas, to scrape, clean, and manipulate my data. 
Then used matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate my results. 

My data used is a blend of the supplied CSV & TSV documents and a dataset of the 1000 top movies that I scraped from IMDB.
